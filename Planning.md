  ### Definition of Problem
    
    I am developing game sorting trash platform for ISAK facilities team. Every year, when new students are coming to school, the facilities team always show and guide the students the way to sort different types of trash. However, this way seems inefficient due to the facilities team still have to rearrange the garbage at the Gomi station every weekend. It takes them lots of time and effort to do this work, and sometimes they cannot finish it because the amount of trash is too significant.
